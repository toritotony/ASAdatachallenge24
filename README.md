# ASA's Data Science Challenge Fall 2024

Contains code relating to ASA's fall 2024 data challenge: 

Participants in the 2024 Fall Data Challenge will engage in the statistical investigative process to explore and analyze police call-for-service data in conjunction with a second dataset of their choice from a city or state government data portal.

I'll specifically be focusing on the California area due to conflicts of interest along with a short period before the due date. 

Will be using R and/or Python, collecting the data locally and/or through API calls and analyzing attempting to use mapping and statistical methods to determine some solutions to reduce heavy policing models, maybe point out negative outputs as a result of those methods.

Also could provide a time series, maybe 2020-2024 or even sooner, that could help visualize the change in certain atributes of these calls dependent on time of year or correlate with geopolitical reasons, etc.
